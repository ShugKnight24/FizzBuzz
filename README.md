# FizzBuzz
FizzBuzz App

I created an app that lists integers 1-100. 
Numbers that are divisible by 3 are replaced with the word "Fizz."
Those divisible by 5 are replaced by the word "Buzz."
Those divisible by both 3 and 5 are replaced with the word "FizzBuzz."
Created a console.log and document.log variation.
